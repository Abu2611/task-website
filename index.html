          Mario[e] is a character created by Japanese video game designer
          Shigeru Miyamoto. He is the title character of the Mario franchise and
          the mascot of Japanese video game company Nintendo. Mario has appeared
          in over 200 video games since his creation. Depicted as a short,
          pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his
          adventures generally center on rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa
          villain Bowser. Mario has access to a variety of power-ups that give
          him different abilities. Mario's fraternal twin brother is Luigi.
          Mario first appeared as the player character of Donkey Kong (1981), a
          platform game. Miyamoto wanted to use Popeye as the protagonist, but
          when he could not achieve the licensing rights, he created Mario
          instead. Miyamoto expected the character to be unpopular and planned
          to use him for cameo appearances; originally called "Mr. Video", he
          was renamed to Mario after Mario Segale. Mario's clothing and
          characteristics were themed after the setting of Donkey Kong. He then
          began to star in the Super Mario series of platform games, beginning
          with the critically acclaimed Super Mario Bros. in 1985. Since 1992,
          Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet.
